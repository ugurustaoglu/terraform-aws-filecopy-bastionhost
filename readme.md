# **AWS - Using BastionHost to copy files to EC2 instances located in Private Network**

In this example, we deployed a public and private network. 
In the public network we deployed a bastionhost, and in the private network we deployed multiple ec2 instances.
We demonstrated how to copy a templated file into the EC2 instances that are generated on the deployment time through bastionhost.
